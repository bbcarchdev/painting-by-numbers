	The variable <var>x</var> denotes the horizontal coordinate in the plot. The formula in <code>calcplot()</code> is used to calculate the value based upon the supplied value of <var>y</var>: <code>return cos(2 * <var>y</var>);</code>
</p>
<p>
	To establish a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to a remote host, one types the <kbd class="command">ssh</kbd> command at the shell prompt (typically ending with <samp class="output prompt">$</samp>). Alternatively, select the <kbd class="menuchoice"><kbd class="guimenu"><samp>Terminal</samp></kbd> → <kbd class="guimenuitem"><samp>New Remote Connection…</samp></kbd><samp class="shortcut"> (Cmd+Shift+K)</samp></kbd> menu option.
</p>
<p>
	Once connected, the <span>Message of the Day</span> (stored in <code class="filename">/etc/motd</code>) is printed, and will typically indicate the version of the operating system running on the host you’ve connected to, such as <samp class="output">3.2.46-1 x86_64</samp>.
