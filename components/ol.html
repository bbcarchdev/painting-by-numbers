	<li>When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.</li>
	<li>Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.

			<li>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again.</li>
			<li>And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.</li>
